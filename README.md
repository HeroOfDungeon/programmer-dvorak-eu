**Dvorak for Programmers with European Keys**
==============================================

This is the usual Dvorak for Programmers keyboard layout (initially made by Ronald Kaufmann) upgraded to include European characters as alternative symbols. Their position match to the main letters mainly inspired by [EurKEY](https://eurkey.steffen.bruentjen.eu) layout (by Steffen Bruentjen). Other special characters distributed among the keys in a reasonable way (in my way of understanding whath "reasonable" is, although feedback is always appreciated).
